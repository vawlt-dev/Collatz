# Collatz Calculator

This is a calculator for the collatz conjecture, it finds the lowest number for any given number of steps.

## Recent features

Instead of incrementing by 1 we now increment by a random number, this seems to make it more efficient for finding larger step counts.

Added a switch to change between incrementing by 1 and incrementing randomly (Converges on 1 as steps approach target)
this is done by a bool statment isFast
